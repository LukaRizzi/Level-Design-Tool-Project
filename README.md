# Level-Design-Tool-Project
Some systems to help people make playable platformer demos inside Unity without programming knowledge

It doesn't use the best programming practices due to it being the most plug and play possible and being made in about a week to help students make level design projects without programming knowledge.
Still I'm produ of how some systems work like the camera one and it uses a couple of scriptable objects for ease of use.
I'll clean up the code a lot and expand the systems once I get a bit more free time. Having to publish these projects definitely wants me to keep working on them and makes me regret having built so much technical debt into them, but I still am proud of them and think they show my knowledge nad pretty good problem solving skills, besides lacking in architecture and design patterns.
